// Question 5

`componentWillMount` is deprecated in the current version of React?

  

//Question 6
  
The second parameter to setState() is an optional callback function that will be executed once setState is completed and after component is re-rendered.
  
  
//Question 7
  
Using dot notation to refer to a react component in JSX like the example below is valid JSX. 

```


<LotsOfComponents.Button>Click me!</LotsOfComponents.Button>



```


//Question 8

Provider and Consumer are part of newer versions of react. They are...

  // imported from react like import {Provider, Consumer} from 'react'
  // available in versions of react 15 and up
  // Typically used at the same level, ie used in the same component
  // available from the object returned by calling React.createConsumer
  
  
// Question 9
 

React.createElement(
  MyButton,
  {color: 'blue', shadowSize: 2},
  'Click Me'
)




This syntax will be deprecated in future versions of React.
